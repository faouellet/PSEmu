This is a collection of mostly very basic tests of the R3000 CPU opcodes and
exception handling. There are however a few exceptions, namely the delayed and
advanced load and unofficial branches tests.

There is no menu available for these tests. Hold L2/R2 and use the D-pad to
move the display in the result display.
